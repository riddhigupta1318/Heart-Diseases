#Heart Diseases Analysis using Tableau

Real wealth is in good health. During the epidemic, we were all aware of the brutal impact that
COVID-19 had on everyone, regardless of status. For better future planning, you must analyze this
health and medical data. Although there are 76 attributes in this database, all published
experiments only use a subset of 14 of them. The Cleveland database in particular is the only one
that ML researchers have used up until this point. The "goal" field alludes to the patient's having
heart disease. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. 

Attribute Information:
1. age 
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values) 
4. resting blood pressure 
5. serum cholesterol in mg/dl 
6. fasting
7. blood sugar > 120 mg/dl>
8. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
9. maximum heartrate achieved
10. Exercise-induced angina
11. Old peak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
12. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
13. A number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
14. Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
